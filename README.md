# Depression and Anxiety Prediction of Students using Electronic Health Records

In this project we are trying to capture the patterns that will lead to depression and anxiety in students pursing bachelor degree.
### DATASET
The dataset can be found [here](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.54qt7).

### RUN THE PROJECT
To run the project:
- cd into root of the project and create a virtual environment with Python 3.9
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run `python main.py`
- 
<br>In modeling.py file, the data has been fitted to the 2 most accurate models, which are Ensemble model, that is consists of Random Forest and base estimator and AdaBoost as boosting technique, and aslo XGBoost which is the second best working model.
<br> 
<br>All .ipynb files are used for experiments and prototyping of choosing the best method in each step.

<br>This project is done as part of the DATA 240 course at SJSU, Spring 2023.
